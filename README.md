# Power-BI
This repo mainly will contain power BI Dashboards, where each dashboard will be a statistical analysis.
I would like to talk about how to measure success for an event using statistical analysis and machine learning models:
1- you have to analyze registration and absence role, you have to compute a measure for that according to your percentage.
2- Keep on eye attendees' engagement.
3-compute attendees drop of rate.
4-Go through individual session rating.
5-Calculate the ration of repetitive attendees.
